## Project goals
**Context:** The company that you work for suspects that credit card distributors have been mailing out cards that have invalid numbers. 
In this project, I have the role of a clerk who checks if credit cards are valid. Every other clerk currently checks using pencil and paper, but Iâ€™ll be optimizing the verification process using functions and loops to handle multiple credit cards at a time. Unlike the other clerks, I want to spend the rest of your time relaxing!

## Technology
Project is created with:
 - ES6 Javascript

 
## Launch
First download the project.

To check is a card number is valid:
```
console.log(validateCred(cardNumber));
```
To check which credit cards are invalid:
```
console.log(findInvalidCards(batch));
```
To determine which companies own the invalid credit cards
```
console.log(idInvalidCardCompanies(batch));
```

To see the result, run node:
```
node main.js
```
